					3.0 star rating

  					<p id="Reviews"> A while back they started offering sofritas which is a tofu vegetarian protein option. I think it's been a great addition to their menu. Just make sure you look inside the container because I've at times seen other non-vegetarian protein items fall in.</p>

					<p id="Reviews">The service is fair. They are usually quick, courteous, and keep the line neat. The food also is kept warm. This restaurant can get pretty torn up during peak hours. By that I mean the seating area can have multiple tables left unclean, tea containers empty, and times when they are not quick to restock utensils, lids, and straws.</p>
